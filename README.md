      Habit Hatchers is a fun, interactive habit-tracking app where you collect "eggs" by completing daily habits. 
      As you collect more eggs, your chicken gets happier, helping you stay motivated to keep track of your progress. 
      Perfect for users who want to gamify their habit-building journey!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Swift, SwiftUI, XCode, Figma

I built this app using Swift and SwiftUI within the Xcode IDE. I began by designing the UI/UX in Figma, creating a user intuitive layout to be

I then implemented this design in Swift, managing key elements such as view transitions, user inputs, and iPhone notifications. Testing was conducted thoroughly by deploying the app on my own iPhone through Xcode, allowing me to fine-tune the user experience.

Current features of the app include:

- **Adding Habit Eggs**: Users can add habits in the form of "eggs," which align with the app's playful theme.
- **Pop-Up Modals**: Easy-to-access pop-ups display a list of all habits, providing a quick overview for users.
- **Habit Metadata Tracking**: The app records essential habit data, such as total habits collected, streaks, creation date, and deletion date.
- **Habit Deletion and Recovery**: Users can delete habits, but they also have the option to recover them, offering flexibility in habit management.
- **Persistent Habit Storage**: Habit data is stored in JSON format, ensuring that progress is maintained across app sessions.
- **System Notification Reminders**: Reminders can be set, prompting users when it's time to complete or check in on their habits.



## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
